A very simple mp3 downloader from Youtube.
This script allows you to download all youtube links from a file (mp3 format) or an entire playlist
If you wish to download the playlist you need to setup the API_KEY variable first (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/key).
## Threading
This script is thread based, you may want to change the maximum thread number in the code variable

it's a python script, you don't really need to install anything
BUT
you may want to check all the requirements (pip3 install requirements.txt)

If you are new to python here is a quick guide on how to run all of this:

2) install python 3.x
3) run the command pip3 install requirements.txt from terminal / cmd
